Title: Visualization of related, multi-level RNA-seq data in a dynamic
        Sankey diagram

Description: Visualize relationships in multi-level RNA-seq data (e.g. miRNA
    and target mRNA expression) as dynamic diagrams embedded in an HTML file.
    Specifically, produce Sankey diagrams (http://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/)
    representing relationships between pairs of interacting molecules as directed
    paths between two nodes. Paths and nodes are coloured based on a quantitative
    value representing relationship strength (e.g. correlation or regulatory score)
    and molecular change (e.g. expression fold change between two conditions).
    Colours used for paths and nodes can be defined by the user to indicate positive
    and negative interaction. This package utilizes the Sankey plugin of the data-
    driven JavaScript library D3 (Copyright 2015 Mike Bostock) to present data
    in all modern browsers, eliminating the need for third-party visualization
    software.
